Hi, I'm NitoTech, a young aspiring reverse engineer hoping to work as an anti-cheat developer or reverse malware engineer!
You can follow my journey as I post blogs on new things I'm learning and small CTFs I complete.
I will make mistakes along the way but that is a part of learning, so feel free to contact me by email or through Twitter with constructive criticism and feedback!
